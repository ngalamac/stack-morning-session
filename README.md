## Challenge description


### Stack

Create a Stack with two methods push and pop. You can use your LinkedList class to keep track of the elements internally (altough it is not a must-have).

Example

This is an example of a test case:

```
const stack = new Stack()
stack.push(3)
stack.push(5)
console.log(stack.pop())
// => 5

stack.push(2)
stack.push(7)
console.log(stack.pop())
// => 7

console.log(stack.pop())
// => 2

console.log(stack.pop())
// => 3
```
